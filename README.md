# Machine-Learning-2018-present-
These are all the machine learning codes that I have used for learning and teaching.

### The files and folders are bifurcated in the following way - 
0. Basics
  * This folder contains some basic jupyter notebooks for Data Science libraries like NumPy, Matplotlib and Pandas.
  
1. Supervised Learning
  * Regression
    * Contains multiple implementations of Linear and Polynomial Regression using different methods like the Normal Equation, Gradient Descent and also an easy implementation with the Scikit-Learn library.
  * Classification
    * Contains multiple implementations (from scratch and using scikit-learn) of Classification Algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Trees and Naive Bayes.
    * Also consists of Neural Network Implementations in Tensorflow like Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Classification, Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTMs) for Sentence Classification & Sequence Tagging.

2. Unsupervised Learning
  * Association Algorithms
    * Consists of Association Rule Mining Algorithms to find patterns in raw data like Apriori Algorithm and FP-Growth.
  * Clustering Algorithms
    * Contains implementations (from scratch and using scikit-learn) for K-Means and Meanshift clustering.
  * Dimensionality Reduction
    * Contains implementation of PCA (Principal Component Analysis) Dimensionality Reduction algorithm.
    
3. Reinforcement Learning
  * Contains multiple implementations of Reinforcement Learning Algorithms like Multiarmed Bandits, Q-Learning, Deep Q Networks with Experience Replay

4. Anomaly Detection
  * Contains implementation of an Anomaly Detection algorithm using Gaussian Estimation.
